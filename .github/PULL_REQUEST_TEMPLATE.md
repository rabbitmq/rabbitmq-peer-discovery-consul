## Proposed Changes

Please describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the
RabbitMQ team why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or
resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.

A pull request that doesn't explain **why** the change was made has a much
lower chance of being accepted.

If English isn't your first language, don't worry about it and try to
communicate the problem you are trying to solve to the best of your abilities.
As long as we can understand the intent, it's all good.
